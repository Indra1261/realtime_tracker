# Real-Time Location Tracker

This project is a real-time location tracking application using **Socket.IO** and **Leaflet.js**. It allows multiple users to share their live location on an interactive map. Each connected user is represented by a unique marker, and the map updates their positions in real-time as they move. This application is deployed on **Railway**

## Features

- Real-time location sharing with automatic geolocation updates.
- Interactive map using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) with **OpenStreetMap** as the tile provider.
- Each connected user has a unique marker on the map.
- Automatic handling of disconnected users by removing their markers from the map.
- Initial centering of the map on the userâ€™s location, with the flexibility to pan and zoom freely without automatic re-centering.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend)
## Troubleshooting
Map re-centers on each update: Check the isFirstUpdate flag in script.js to ensure the map only centers on the user's location when they first connect.
WebSocket connection errors: Ensure that your backend URL is accessible from your frontend, especially for CORS settings on Railway.
